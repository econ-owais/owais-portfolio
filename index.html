      <div class="card p-8 text-center max-w-4xl mx-auto space-y-4">
        <p class="text-lg text-gray-700">I chose economics because I wanted to understand how systems work how decisions ripple through communities, how policies shape lives, and how data can tell stories that matter. It wasn’t just theory for me; I wanted to use it to fix things, build smarter tools, and make public services actually serve.</p>
        <p class="text-lg text-gray-700">Along the way, I picked up tech skills that helped me turn ideas into action. With R, Stata, and Shiny, I started building dashboards, mapping flood risks, and analyzing budgets for central banks and government teams. I’ve worked on everything from welfare planning to transport systems always focused on clarity, impact, and real-world use.</p>
        <p class="text-lg text-gray-700">I care about making things simple, sharp, and accessible. Whether it’s a policy report or a public-facing app, I push every detail until it works for everyone. Outside the data world, I’ve led student teams, mentored others, and helped communities during floods. For me, it’s all connected economics, tech, design, and outreach.</p>
        <p class="text-lg text-gray-700">This is more than a career. It’s how I build things that matter.</p>
